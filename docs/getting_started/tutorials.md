# Tutorials

The tutorials located in *tutorials* serve as a starting point for new users to get familiar with the workflow of EL-PASO.

It is recommended to follow the numbering of files since the tutorials gradually build up one processing pipeline.

Tutorials covering more advanced topics are marked as *advanced*. These contents should not be necessary for every-day-use.
