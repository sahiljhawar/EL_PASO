        file_path (Path): The path to the single output file where all data will be saved.

    Methods:
        __init__(file_path): Initializes the strategy with the file path and sets up the single output file configuration.
        get_time_intervals_to_save: Returns the entire time range as a single interval.
        get_file_path: Always returns the pre-defined single file path.
